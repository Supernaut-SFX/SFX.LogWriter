# SFX.LogWriter
PowerShell Script Module part of the 'PSFX.ScriptUtilities' collection of Utility Modules. 'SFX.LogWriter' is a simple Module which aims to provide a well written, structured, and versatile set of PowerShell Functions/Cmdlets, Scripts, Classes, and Enums, all for the purpose of creating and writing data to well formatted, Human Readable LogFiles. It is, by design, built to be incorporated into other Projects to provide easy to use, intuitive logging for Scripts, Functions, Modules, and more, yet is also equipped so as to still be useful for general use as a stand-alone Module for tasks ranging from mere Note-Taking to keep track of information related to what's currently happening in the PowerShell Console, to on-the-fly logging for said general use of the Shell. Log Entries can be kept simple, with nothing more written to the LogFile at a time than just a Timestamp, Log level, and a Message, however, additional features are included for writing data from various sources to any given Entry, such as information stored in a number of PowerShell's Automatic Variables ($LASTEXITCODE, $Error, $ErrorRecord, etc.), and for those not included as Function Parameters in either UserLogging or ScriptLogging Commands, or for User created Variables and Objects, all Logging Functions include an '-InputObject' Parameter used for passing any Object to the LogFile, as well as an '-ObjectDescription' Parameter for defining said Object.
